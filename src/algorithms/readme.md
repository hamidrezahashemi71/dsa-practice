Big O notation:
help us understand:
how long an algorithm will take to run (Time Complexity)
how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows (Space Complexity)

concept:
How the cleaning time grows as the mess gets bigger

O(n): Execution time of the algorithm grows linearly in proportion to the size of the input data (n).
As the number of items in the input data increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run increases correspondingly.

O(1): aka constant time, execution time remains constant regardless of input size.
Example: A box filled with items, we know exactly where each item is located. Te get a specific item, you go directly to its location, taking the same amount of time regardless of how many items are in the box.

O(n^2): Algorithm execution time grows quadratically with the size of input data.
Example: a box of items, the goal is comparing each item with every other item to find specific pairs. as the number of items (n) increases, the number of computations (n^2) grows much faster.

O(log n): Algorithm running time grows logarithmically with the size of the input (represented by n). In simpler terms, as the input size increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run, increases slowly.
